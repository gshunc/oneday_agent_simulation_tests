## Danger signs 2 months – 5 years

EVERY CHILD must be assessed for danger signs. These are SIGNS, which means you must observe them yourself. The only one you cannot observe is convulsions, where you must ask the mother to demonstrate.

### 1\. CANNOT TAKE BREASTMILK OR WATER

- Ask the mother to offer breastmilk or water.
- If the child's nose is blocked, clear the nose before the child attempts to feed.

### 2\. VOMITS ALL BREASTMILK OR WATER

- If the child can still keep down water or milk sometimes, they DO NOT have this danger sign.
- Check by offering the child breastmilk, or water from a cup

### 3\. CONVULSION

- Ask the mother if the child has had any convulsions during this current illness.
- Ask the mother to show you with her body what happened with the child
- In a convulsion, the whole body will shake rhythmically, and the child will be slow to wake up properly afterwards. Sometimes (but not always) they will bite their tongue or froth at the mouth, or urinate/defecate themselves.

### 4\. LETHARGIC OR UNCONSCIOUS

- A lethargic child is not awake and alert when she should be. The child is drowsy and does not show interest in what is happening around them. Often the lethargic child does not look at his mother or watch your face when you talk. The child may stare blankly and appear not to notice what is going on around them.
- An unconscious child cannot be wakened.
- Note: If the child is sleeping and has cough or difficult breathing, count the number of breaths first before you try to wake the child.

### ACTIONS: if there are any danger signs you must:

1. Check the blood sugar. If it is less than 3mmol/L give 25% dextrose 2ml/kg IV (Dilute 50% dextrose with the same volume of normal saline to make 25% dextrose) STAT
2. Test for malaria with an MRDT. If this is positive, also give artesunate IM/IV. If the child is less than 20kg, give 3mg/kg. If the child is 20kg or more, give 2.4mg/kg.
3. Give ceftriaxone 100mg/kg IM/IV STAT
4. Refer to hospital immediately. Communicate that the child must go to hospital to save their life.

## Danger signs less than 2 months

EVERY CHILD must be assessed for danger signs. These signs only apply to children under 2 months, and danger signs are different for those over 2 months. These are SIGNS, which means you must observe them yourself. Children under 2 months are very vulnerable, and are at high risk of becoming sick quickly or dying.

### 1\. ANY DANGER SIGNS FROM THE LIST 2 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS

### 2\. FAST BREATHING

- The breathing rate should be less than 60 breaths per minute. Repeat the count if elevated.
- If the repeat count is also above 60 breaths per minute, the baby has fast breathing.

### 3\. SEVERE CHEST INDRAWING, NASAL FLARING AND/OR GRUNTING

- Mild chest indrawing is normal in young infants because the chest wall is soft, but severe chest indrawing is a sign of pneumonia and is serious in a young infant.
- Nasal flaring is widening of the nostrils when the young infant breathes in.
- Grunting is a soft, short sounds a young infant makes when breathing out.

### 4\. BULGING FONTANELLE

- Hold the infant in an upright position and the infant must not be crying.
- If the fontanelle is bulging, this may mean the infant has meningitis.

### 5\. UMBILICUS THAT IS RED/DRAINING PUS

- Does the redness extend to the skin of the abdomen? If it does, it is a serious infection.
- Note: the cord usually drops from the umbilicus by one week of age.

### 6\. HIGH or LOW TEMPERATURE

- Fever (\> 37.5°C) or hypothermia (less than 35.5°C)
- This may be the only sign of a serious bacterial infection.
- This sign is very important and often missed as a danger sign, every baby must have their temperature checked.

### 7\. SKIN PUSTULES (5 or more pustules, or one pustule of 1cm or bigger)

- Skin pustules are spots or blisters that contain pus.
- Examine the skin on the entire body. Fully undress the baby to check

### 8\. ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS

- An infant who doesn't move their arms, legs or head in a minute while you watch closely
- An infant whose movements seem unusual to you – not like a normal baby

### ACTIONS: If there are ANY of these signs above which might indicate bacterial infection you must:

1. Check the blood sugar. If it is less than 3mmol/L give 25% dextrose 2ml/kg IV (Dilute 50% dextrose with the same volume of normal saline to make 25% dextrose) STAT.
2. Give ceftriaxone 100mg/kg IM/IV STAT. (If less than 2 weeks old, give 50mg/kg instead)
3. Refer to hospital immediately. Communicate they must reach hospital to save their life.
4. Instruct the mother to keep the baby wrapped up in blankets and warm

## Diarrhoea and dehydration in children

Follow the steps as below, at a minimum you will follow steps 1, 2 and 3

### STEP 1: Assess dehydration \- either Severe, Some or None

**Severe Dehydration – TWO or more the following signs**

- Lethargic or unconscious
- Sunken eyes
- Not able to drink or drinking poorly.
- Skin pinch goes back very slowly (more than 2 seconds)

**Some Dehydration – TWO or more of the following signs**

- Restless, irritable
- Sunken eyes
- Drinks eagerly, thirsty
- Skin pinch goes back slowly (more than 1 second)

**No dehydration – No signs, or only one sign of dehydration**

### STEP 2: Treat dehydration – either Severe, Some or None

**To calculate drip speed:** Total volume (mls) ÷ time (minutes) × 20 \= Drops per minute

**TREATMENT: Severe Dehydration** Give IV fluids – Ringers Lactate if available, otherwise give normal saline. First give 30ml/kg

- If less than 12 months, give it over 1 hour.
- If 12 months or above, give it over 30 minutes.

Then give 70ml/kg

- If less than 12 months, give it over 5 hours.
- If 12 months or above, give it over 2.5 hours.

Reassess the child regularly (every 30 minutes) and if they are not improving, speed up the drip. As soon as they can drink, give ORS at 5ml/kg/hour. Reassess the child after the treatment and either move on to treating as "some dehydration" or "no dehydration" or repeat "severe dehydration".

**TREATMENT: Some Dehydration** Give ORS 20ml/kg/hour for 4 hours. Show the mother how much the child should drink each hour.

- Give frequent sips every few minutes from a small cup.
- Continue breastfeeding if the child wants.
- If the child vomits, wait for 10 minutes, and then continue giving ORS.
- If the child wants more ORS, give them more.
- Reassess the child after the treatment and either move on to treating as "no dehydration" or "severe dehydration" or repeat "some dehydration".

**TREATMENT: No Dehydration and Discharge** Discharge home with ORS and zinc tablets.

Show the mother how to mix ORS and give her at least 2 sachets. The child should drink at least 100ml of ORS after every loose stool. If the child vomits, wait 10 minutes, and then continue giving ORS.

Give zinc tablets

- If less than 6 months – 10mg zinc once a day for 10 days.
- If 6 months to 5 years – 20mg zinc once a day for 10 days.

Communicate:

- If the child gets worse or cannot feed, they must come back.
- Diarrhoea is often caused by poor hygiene around the home.
- Children should wash their hands after short and long calls and before eating.
- There should be a hand washing station outside the toilet.
- ORS should only be made with clean water that has been boiled.
- If breastfed, continue breastfeeding frequently and for longer.

### STEP 3: IS THERE BLOOD IN THE DIARRHOEA?

If No, do not give more medication – ORS and zinc is enough If Yes, treat as above AND give antibiotics as below.

If under 6 months, unable to swallow tablets or less than 6kg, refer to hospital

**First line: Ciprofloxacin:**

- 6-10kg – 125mg (¼ tablet) twice a day for 3 days
- 10-25kg – 250mg (½ tablet) twice a day for 3 days
- if \>25kg and adults – 500mg (1 tablet) twice a day for 3 days. If there is not improvement within 48hrs move to second line.

**Second line: Azithromycin:**

- 6-12kg – 125mg (¼ tablet) once a day for 4 days
- 13-25kg – 250mg (½ tablet) on day one, and then 125mg (¼ tablet) once a day for 4 days.
- if \>25kg– 500mg day one, and then 250mg (½ tablet) OD for 4 days. If there is not improvement within 48hrs move to third line.

**Third line: Metronidazole**

- 6-12 months – 100mg (½ tablet) three times a day for 5 days
- 1-2 years – 200mg (1 tablet) three times a day for 5 days
- 3-6 years – 300mg (1 \+ ½ tablets) three times a day for 5 days
- 7- 9years– 400mg (2 tablets) three times a day for 5 days
- 10 years plus – 800mg (4 tablets) three times a day for 5 days If there is not improvement after treatment, refer to hospital.

If no improvement with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin after 2 weeks, it is likely to be caused by parasitic amoeba. Move onto Step 4

### STEP 4: HAS THE DIARRHOEA LASTED LONGER THAN 2 WEEKS?

If yes, encourage oral intake and treat for possible giardiasis. If still breastfeeding, feed more frequently and for longer. If no longer breast feeding, give nutrient rich semi-solid food, like porridge mixed with milk.

**Treat for possible giardiasis** **First line: Metronidazole**

- 1-2 years – 500mg (2 \+ ½ tablets at once) once a day for 3 days.
- 3-6 years – 800mg (4 tablets at once) once a day for 3 days.
- 7-9 years – 1g (5 tablets at once) once a day for 3 days.
- if \>10 year and adults – 400mg (2 tablets) three times a day 5 days.

Review in 5 days. If no improvement, refer to hospital.

## Cough and breathing problems in children

If the cough has lasted more than 30 days already, see chronic cough guideline. The most important part of this guideline is checking for fast breathing, which you should do for every patient with cough

### Decision Flow:

**1\. Does the child have any danger signs?**

- IF YES → Treat as per Danger Signs
- IF NO → Continue to next question

**2\. Does the child have Chest Indrawing OR Stridor?**

- IF YES → **Treat as severe pneumonia**
- Give IM Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg STAT max 1g
- Immediately refer to hospital
- Explain that there is a life-threatening infection in the chest.
- IF NO → Continue to next question

**3\. Is the child breathing fast?** Count the breaths in 30 seconds and multiply by 2\. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST and every patient with cough MUST have respiratory rate tested. Fast breathing is:

- 2 \- 12m: \> 50 breaths per minute

- 1 \- 5y: \> 40 breaths per minute

- IF YES → **Treat as pneumonia (non-severe)**

- Give amoxicillin for 5 days:
- \<1 month: 30mg/kg
- 1-11 months: 125mg TDS
- 1-4 years: 250mg TDS
- if \> 5 years: 500mg TDS
- AND paracetamol/ibuprofen
- Communicate as below.

Second-line: Azithromycin for 3 days

- \<15kg \= 125mg (1/4 tab) OD
- 15-35kg \= 250mg (1/2 tab) OD
- if \>35kg \= 500mg (1 tab) OD
- IF NO → Continue to next question

**4\. Are the tonsils red and swollen? (Use tongue depressor to look)**

- IF YES → **Treat as tonsilitis**
- Give amoxicillin as above (same as pneumonia)
- AND paracetamol/ibuprofen
- Communicate as below
- IF NO → **Treat as Upper Respiratory Tract infection**
- If the child is otherwise well, communicate and treat:
- 0-2 months: don't give medication and review daily. Look for danger signs.
- 3 months and older: First give one of these 2 medications
- Paracetamol (see dosing section)
- OR Ibuprofen (see dosing section)
- AND add one of these medications
- Piritex syrup if \<1 year
- OR Cough Linctus if \>1 year
- OR cetirizine (If child is over 3 years)

**Communicate**

- Explain where the infection is (chest, throat or nose and throat) and that it should improve with the medications.
- Return immediately if the breathing worsens or if there is no improvement after 3 days, but the cough may persist.
- Avoid smoke, as this damages the lungs and causes pneumonia.
- Cook outside with a charcoal stove, and never inside or with wood.
- Come back if the breathing gets worse.

---

## UTI in children

FIRST CHECK FOR DANGER SIGNS

Suspect a UTI if:

- Fever (\>37.5°C) OR burning/pain when passing urine
- AND a negative MRDT
- AND there is no new cough or flu Other symptoms might include vomiting, abdominal pain, urinary incontinence and irritability.

**Medicate**

- 2 \- 12 months: co-trimoxazole PO 240mg (1/2 tablet) BD 5/7
- 1 \- 5 years: co-trimoxazole PO 480mg (1 tablet) BD 5/7
- 5 \- 11 years: cefalexin 250mg PO TDS 5/7

**Communicate:**

- there is an infection, probably in the urinary system. \-Drink plenty of fluids.
- If is no improvement in 48hrs or if there is any worsening then come back.

---

## UTI in Adults

Suspect a UTI if burning pain when passing urine OR passing urine more frequently than usual OR urinary urgency OR change in urine appearance (including blood) suprapubic pain.

### Decision Flow:

**1\. Is there abnormal discharge OR significant itch in the vagina or on the penis?** (Any discharge in men, or a change from their normal discharge in women). No-one with discharge should ever be diagnosed with a UTI.

- IF YES → Instead follow the Vaginal Discharge or Penile Discharge guideline and do not diagnose UTI
- IF NO → Continue to next question

**2\. Are there any of the following:** fevers OR abdominal flank pain/tenderness OR vomiting OR nausea?

- IF YES → **Treat as Pyelonephritis**

- Ceftriaxone 1g IV STAT and refer to hospital.
- Communicate: infection has spread from the bladder to the kidneys. This can be a serious infection and so they must go to hospital. Drink plenty of water.
- IF NO → **Medicate Female:**

- Non-pregnant: Ciprofloxacin 500mg BD 3/7
- Pregnant: Amoxicillin 500mg TDS 7/7)
- Communicate: mild infection of the bladder
1. Drink plenty of water.
2. Pass urine after sex to prevent UTIs.
3. Return if no improvement or worsening.

**Medicate Male**

- Ciprofloxacin 500mg BD 7/7
- Communicate: infection of urinary system
1. Drink plenty of water.
2. Return if no improvement or worsening.

---

## Malaria

### Decision Flow:

**1\. If a child, do they have any danger signs?**

- IF YES →
1. Treat as per Danger Signs in Children
2. Immediately refer to hospital.
- IF NO → Continue

**2\. Perform RDT \- ALWAYS Perform an MRDT if there is any fever reported by the patient or caregiver, OR if you measure a fever yourself at the clinic. Keep in mind there are some symptoms that malaria CANNOT cause, and therefore if they are there you may need to diagnose 2 conditions. These symptoms include**
**1\) Cough, 2\) Flu (runny nose), 3\) Vaginal or penile Discharge 4\) Skin rashes or swelling.**  Fever (history of fever/coldness, or recorded \>37.5°C)

- Vomiting \- Anaemia (pale conjunctiva)
- Headache \- Jaundice (yellow eyes)
- Abdominal pain \- Splenomegaly
- Unwell with no other obvious cause

**IF MRDT NEGATIVE:** DO NOT TREAT for malaria. Consider other causes, such as: meningitis, UTI, possible typhoid, gastroenteritis, pneumonia or viral illness

**IF MRDT POSITIVE:**

**3\. Are there signs of severe malaria?**

1) Impaired consciousness (Lethargy, drowsiness, unconsciousness, or confusion)
2) Convulsions (history of, or witnessed)?
3) Abnormal breathing: deep breathing or chest indrawing, or SpO2 \<92%
4) Prostration (can't sit or stand without assistance)?
5) Severe anaemia (check conjunctiva – or a Hb of \<5 for \<12 year olds, or \<7 for adults on CBC)
6) Hypoglycaemia (blood sugar \<3mmol/L)
7) Hyper-parasitaemia (+++ on blood film)
8) Spontaneous bleeding
9) Low BP – systolic BP \<90 in adults, \<70 in children, or cold peripheries.
10) Jaundice (yellow eyes) OR the patient can't take oral medication due to vomiting?
- IF YES to ANY → **TREAT AS SEVERE MALARIA:**

1. Give IV/IM artesunate STAT
- If \<20kg 3mg/kg. If \>20kg, 2.4mg/kg
- (if unavailable IM artemether 3.2mg/kg)
2. Check the blood sugar.
- If \<3mmol/L give 25% dextrose 2ml/kg IV STAT
- (Dilute 50% dextrose with the same amount of normal saline to make 25%)
3. Give IV/IM ceftriaxone STAT
- 100mg/kg, maximum 2g.
4. If dehydrated (child) or in shock (adult), give IV normal saline STAT
- 10ml/kg, maximum 500ml
5. Refer to hospital immediately
6. Communicate: the patient has life-threatening malaria and must go to hospital for treatment. After completing the IV treatment, they must complete 3 days of coartem
- IF NO to ALL → **MEDICATE AS NON-SEVERE MALARIA:**

1. Consider other illnesses as well, especially in adults and children \>5 years.
2. Coartem
- 5-15kg: 1 tablet twice daily for 3 days
- 15-25kg: 2 tablets twice daily for 3 days.
- 25-35kg: 3 tablets twice daily for 3 days
- if \>35kg: 4 tablets twice daily for 3 days.
3. Paracetamol or ibuprofen (see dosing section) NOTE coartem alternatives have different doses

**Communicate:**

- You must take all 3 days of coartem even after completing injections of severe malaria
- Come back if you become more unwell, or do not improve within 3 days
- Sleep under a mosquito net with no holes in it.
- Never wash nets as this removes insecticide.
- If somebody comes to spray your house, this is safe and prevents malaria \- let them spray

---

## Meningitis

Meningitis can kill fast, so if you suspect meningitis, leave all other work and treat the patient quickly.

**Suspect meningitis if a patient has:**

1. A fever (\>37.5°C) AND
2. Neck stiffness OR sensitivity to light OR headache with vomiting OR a bulging fontanelle OR
3. Impaired consciousness (confusion, lethargy, drowsiness or unconsciousness) with no other obvious cause (such as head injury, alcohol or cerebral malaria)

**If meningitis is suspected:**

1. Give ceftriaxone IM STAT \- 100mg/kg in children, 2g in adults.
2. Perform an MRDT immediately – if positive, also treat as severe malaria, but still refer as below.
3. Refer to hospital immediately – They must do lumbar punctures and has inpatient beds. This must be very fast, as meningitis kills quickly.
4. All household contacts of the suspected case must be given a single dose of ciprofloxacin. Bacterial meningitis can spread in household contacts, but taking a single dose of ciprofloxacin reduces this risk by 90%.
- 10 years and older, give ciprofloxacin 1x 500mg tablet.
- 9 years and younger, give ciprofloxacin 500mg tablet (250mg).

**Communicate:**

1. Meningitis is a very serious infection of the lining of the brain.
2. It can kill very quickly, so we will give treatment immediately, before sending to a hospital that is able to confirm meningitis.
3. Meningitis is diagnosed by performing a lumbar puncture, when they insert a needle to the base of the spine and take a small amount of fluid to test.
4. Meningitis is infectious and can cause outbreaks. Close contacts, particularly household contacts, are at risk of catching it. If all household contacts take a single dose of ciprofloxacin, then this can prevent the transmission 9 out of 10 times

---

## Typhoid

**Suspect typhoid if a patient has**

1. A history of at least 3 days of fevers or coldness AND a recorded fever (\>37.5°C) today. You MUST record a fever in the clinic to diagnose possible typhoid
2. A negative MRDT AND no other cause for fever after asking many questions to rule out all other causes (for example URTI, pneumonia, skin infection). Make sure you ask questions about all other conditions before diagnosing typhoid. No-one with these symptoms below should be diagnosed with possible typhoid.
\- Diarrhoea	\- Cough and Flu 	\- Discharge	\- Skin symptoms	\- Pain on urination

There is no good test for typhoid. Do not do the Widal test – it is unreliable and is often positive when typhoid is not there and often negative when typhoid is actually there.

Typhoid is impossible to definitively diagnose at a Health Centre level, and so you should not tell a patient that they definitely have typhoid, but you can tell them that they have possible typhoid. You can diagnose possible typhoid clinically, without extra tests, providing they meet the above criteria.

### Decision Flow:

**1\. If a child, do they have any danger signs?**

- IF YES →
1. Treat as per Danger Signs in Children
2. Immediately refer to hospital.
- IF NO → Continue

**2\. Are there any signs of the complications of typhoid? These are:** a. Signs of abdominal perforation? Severe abdominal pain with guarding. b. Signs of a GI bleed? Vomiting blood, or passing melena (very dark/black, sticky faeces) c. Signs of encephalopathy? Confusion or impaired consciousness. d. Shock? Systolic BP \<90 in adults or \<70 in children or cold peripheries.

- IF YES → **Treat as complicated typhoid fever:**

1) Ceftriaxone 100mg/kg IV STAT (max 2g).
2) Adults: 500ml NaCl 0.9% STAT. Children: 20ml/kg NaCl 0.9% STAT.
3) Refer to hospital immediately.
- IF NO → **Treat as possible uncomplicated typhoid fever:**

1) Ciprofloxacin
- 10-19kg – 250mg (½ tablet) BD for 7 days
- 20-35kg – 500mg (1 tablet) BD for 7 days.
- if \>35kg – 750mg (1+½ tablet) BD for 7 days
2) Paracetamol (see dosing section) for 5 days.
3) Communicate for "possible typhoid".

**Communicate for "possible typhoid":**

2) Explain that you are treating possible typhoid but the diagnosis can't be confirmed.
3) Explain that typhoid is spread by faecal-oral transmission. Discuss the importance of handwashing.
4) If the patient worsens, they should return and be given Ceftriaxone 1g stat before hospital referral

## Brucellosis

Brucellosis is an infection of animals that can be transmitted to humans. The animals affected include cattle (cows), sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. In addition, brucellosis can be transmitted through milk and dairy products not properly heated. Those raising animals and involved with butchering are at risk. It is not transmitted by eating meat of an infected animal as long as the meat is properly cooked.

### DIAGNOSIS

- ONLY diagnose through a positive BAT agglutination test. Do not diagnose based only on clinical signs. We can also treat if the patient has tested positive at another facility or laboratory.
- Recurrent fevers are typical and may last for many weeks
- The fevers can be worse at night and accompanied by profuse sweating
- Pain in the back, long bones and joints are common
- Patients, especially children can present with only a single joint involved (e.g. hip or knee)
- Cough can occur but the chest generally sounds clear
- Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can occur

To follow treatment progress or diagnosis recurrence, titres can be tested from outside laboratories.

### MEDICATE

Brucellosis treatment ALWAYS needs 2 antibiotics

**First line treatment**

1) Doxycycline 100 mg bd for 6 weeks (84 tablets)
- For children under 8 years the dose is 2 mg/kg per dose
- Remind patients to stay upright for one hour after taking doxycycline
2) Ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd for 10 days (20 tablets)
- Avoid in children under 6 years old

**Second line treatment – Use if first line fails, or if patient develops brucellosis a second time** Lower level facilities without renal function testing available nearby should refer to St. Philips or a hospital for gentamycin treatment. Creatinine should be tested at least every 3 days while on gentamycin, and treatment stopped if creatinine significantly increases.

1) Doxycycline 100 mg bd for 6 weeks (84 tablets)
2) Gentamicin (5 mg per kg) IV OD for 14 days is an alternative to Ciprofloxacin For a child under 8 years old, give Gentamycin 3.5 mg/kg BD
- IF there are complications such as meningitis or endocarditis, refer to hospital.
- If pregnant, DO NOT TREAT as doxycycline and gentamycin are contraindicated. Refer to hospital immediately.

### COMMUNICATE

- Patients must complete the full 6 weeks of medication, even if they are getting better
- There is a small chance that the disease can re-occur after treatment is finished. A diagnosis of brucellosis recurrence should be made using titres, not just a positive BAT test.
- Maternal brucellosis can be a cause of miscarriage. Advise patients to avoid pregnancy if infected
- Pregnant patients may breastfeed

---

## Adults: Acute cough/Breathing problem (\< 2 wks)

- First Check HIV status – If no test in last 6 months, test for HIV
- If the patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, or you have information they are not virally supressed, Give IV Ceftriaxone 1g Stat and refer immediately to hospital

### Decision Flow:

**1\. Does the patient have signs of pneumonia?**

1. A new cough (or a worsening of a chronic cough) AND at least 2 of the following symptoms:
- Fast breathing (RR \> 20 per minute) OR reported difficulty in breathing
- Crackling sounds in one lung on listening
- green/bloody sputum
- fevers (reported or recorded)
- Chest pain worse on coughing or a deep breath
- IF NO → The disease is likely to not be pneumonia, consider "other causes of cough" (see next section).
- IF YES → Continue to next question

**2\. Are there ANY signs of severe pneumonia?**

1. Very Fast breathing (RR \>30)
2. Use of chest or neck muscles to breath
3. Low oxygen levels SpO2 \<92%
4. Confusion
5. Systolic BP \<90
- IF YES → **Treat as Severe Pneumonia**

- Give IV ceftriaxone 2g STAT and doxycycline 200mg PO STAT.
- Refer to hospital.
- If the systolic BP is \<90, also give 500ml NaCl 0.9% STAT.
- Communicate: there is a life-threatening chest infection. They must go to hospital.
- IF NO → **Medicate for Non-Severe pneumonia**

1. Amoxicillin 500mg TDS 5/7
2. Paracetamol/ibuprofen
3. All adults with pneumonia should get an HIV test Communicate as non-severe pneumonia.

Second line: If no improvement after amoxicillin Give: Non-pregnant: 100mg doxycycline BD 5/7 OR Pregnant: 500mg azithromycin day 1, then 250mg (half tab) once daily for 4 days

**Communicate: non-severe pneumonia**

2. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs.
3. If they are not feeling improvement after 3 days, they must come back (the cough can last for weeks) for second-line treatment.
4. If the cough lasts for more than a month, they must come back, as they will need TB testing.
5. Avoid smoke, as this damages the lungs. Cook outside with charcoal.

---

## Other Causes of Acute Cough

### Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI)

If there is cough and flu, but a normal sounding chest and no fast breathing, it is likely to be an upper respiratory tract infection.

If there is pain in the throat, look at the tonsils. If they are covered in pus or are red/swollen, treat as tonsilitis with Amoxicillin 500mg TDS 5/7 and paracetamol/ibuprofen (see dosing section) and cough syrup.

If they have an URTI without tonsilitis, treat with paracetamol/ibuprofen (see dosing section) and cough linctus

Explain to the patient that there is infection in the nose and throat or sinuses and that it should improve within a week. Come back if there is difficulty breathing or is no improvement in a week.

### Heart failure: A chronic disease with intermittent acute episodes. If you suspect see guideline.

- The shortness of breath is much worse when lying flat.
- White frothy/bubbly sputum. Often with new or worsening leg swelling.
- Much more common in older people,

### Asthma: A chronic disease with acute exacerbations or attacks.

- More common in children, or adults with a long history of the same problem since childhood
- shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough.
- Usually worse at night/morning
- Can be triggered by cold weather or exercise or URTIs.
- You should hear a wheeze throughout the chest, not just in one lung or part of the lungs

---

## Chronic Cough (\>1 month):

The most important causes of chronic cough are:

1. TB
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
3. Asthma
4. Heart Failure
5. Non-serious causes: post infection (chest infection or URTI), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), allergic rhinitis and post-nasal drip.

Consider a chest x-ray in all patients with a chronic cough after TB testing. This can help diagnose the cause of chronic cough if it is not clear.

Note: in children, the most important causes of chronic cough are TB, asthma and nonserious causes.

All patients with a chronic cough (productive or dry) require referral to hospital for TB testing.

---

## Tuberculosis (TB):

**Suspect TB if ANY of the following:**

- Cough for \>1 month
- Persistent fevers
- Excessive night sweats
- Weight loss
- Coughing up blood
- Pneumonia not improving with first or second line treatment

**Risk factors for TB:**

- Many people have no risk factors for TB
- HIV – people living with HIV are about 25x more likely to get TB
- Diabetes – people living with diabetes are about 3x more likely to get TB
- Smokers – people who smoke are about 2x more likely to get TB

If you suspect TB, they must have their sputum tested. If laboratory testing is not available at your clinic, refer to a hospital which has testing available.

For many groups of patients, a negative ZN-stain smear is not good enough to exclude TB. See below for when to send for Gene Xpert testing.

This includes HIV positive patients. It is especially important that they have Gene Xpert testing if they have a negative sputum smear.

**Consider re-referring for TB if…**

- The patient has not had a Gene Xpert sputum test (instead only ZN-stain smear or a chest x-ray) AND
- Blood-stained sputum
- OR multiple symptoms of TB: chronic cough, fevers, night sweats or weight loss (or lack of weight gain in children)
- OR HIV positive
- OR child \<14 years
- OR from a refugee camp or prison
- OR has diabetes
- OR pregnant/breastfeeding
- OR possible relapse of previously treated TB
- OR household contact of multidrug resistant TB patient OR
- They develop more TB symptoms (blood in sputum, night sweats and/or weight loss)

---

## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:

**Consider Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) if:**

- The chronic cough is often productive (although mild COPD might start with a dry cough)
- AND the patient is \>40 years
- AND the patient has either smoked cigarettes a lot OR has spent many years exposed to smoke from cooking indoors.

There may also be:

- Crackles or wheeze throughout both lungs
- Recurrent chest infections known as Exacerbations of COPD (see below)

**Exacerbations of COPD:**

- If you suspect a patient has COPD and their chronic cough has worsened, their sputum has turned yellow/green or they are having breathing difficulties then follow the Acute Cough/Breathing Difficulties guidelines.
- AND add prednisolone 30mg OD 5/7 to their treatment for pneumonia.

**Communicate:**

- COPD is lung damage caused by smoke. The damage is irreversible.
- The aim is to prevent further damage and to prevent recurrent exacerbations/chest infections.
- The only thing that will prevent further damage and chest infections is removing ALL smoke.
- If they smoke: they must immediately stop smoking.
- If they cook in a smoky room:
1. Immediately stop cooking indoors. They must cook outside.
2. Never cook with wood. Instead cook with charcoal as it produces less smoke.
3. They should use an efficient charcoal stove, as this will produce even less smoke.
- The only medications that will help with the symptoms are inhalers. Tablets are only helpful if there is an exacerbation of COPD.
- Carefully explain to the patient how to use a salbutamol inhaler.
- Advise them to come back if any worsening of the cough or breathing or if the sputum becomes yellow/green.

**Medicate: you must demonstrate how to use the inhaler.**

- Salbutamol inhaler 2 puffs as required, up to four times a day.

---

## Asthma:

**Consider asthma if...**

- The patient is \>2yrs old.
- AND the cough is a non-productive dry cough or clear/white sputum.
- AND the cough/breathing is worse at night or in the morning and improves during the day.
- There is chest tightness, feeling unable to take a deep breath in.
- You can hear wheeze when you listen to the chest.

Asthma often develops in childhood, so there will probably be a long history of breathing problems. It may be triggered by cold weather, exercise or URTIs.

### 1 – Check for an asthma attack

Patients with asthma may have acute asthma attacks. This presents with worsening symptoms:

1) increased difficulty breathing, 2\) increased chest tightness and 3\) increased wheeze. Asthma attacks vary is severity from mild to life-threatening.

If you suspect a patient with a history of asthma and is having an asthma attack:

- Check for Danger Signs if a child.
- Check for any signs of a severe or life-threatening asthma attack:
- Fast breathing. Count the breaths per minute: \>25 in adults. \>30 in 5-12yrs, \>50 if \<5yrs.
- Fast heart rate. \>110 in adults. \>120 in 5-12yrs. \>130 if \<5 yrs.
- Can't talk in full sentences.
- Reduced consciousness
- Low oxygen levels SpO2 \<92%

If any of these are present:

1. Give 2mg/kg prednisolone PO STAT (max 40mg)
2. Give 10 puffs of salbutamol inhaler.
3. Refer immediately to hospital for life-saving treatment.
- If no signs of a severe or life-threatening asthma attack, treat as mild/moderate asthma attack:
- Give 4 puffs of salbutamol inhaler. Repeat every 20 mins if needed. AND
- \<12yrs: 1mg/kg prednisolone OD 3/7 (max 40mg)
- 12yrs+: 40mg prednisolone OD 5/7
- Return immediately if worsening.

### 2 – Communicate:

- Asthma is not an infection. It is a long-term condition. Half of children with asthma will grow out of it, but for many, including adults that develop asthma, it is lifelong.
- Avoid potential triggers. This includes smoke (see COPD guidelines on reducing smoke), chemicals and certain medications such as propranolol (and other beta-blockers).
- Explain and demonstrate carefully how to use an inhaler.
- Explain that the patient should carry their inhaler with them, as asthma attacks can kill quickly.
- If worsening of symptoms, they must return immediately.

### 3 – Medicate: asthma without an acute asthma attack

- 2 puffs of salbutamol inhaler QDS long-term.
- They can give more salbutamol, but if needing more salbutamol, they should come back for assessment of possible asthma attack.

If they are having recurrent asthma attacks, there is no improvement with salbutamol or there is insufficient improvement with salbutamol, refer to hospital.

---

## Heart failure

**Heart Failure will have:**

- The cough is either dry or has white frothy/bubbly sputum AND
- The cough and shortness of breath is much worse when lying down AND
- Either the patient is old (\>60 years) or has a history of Rheumatic Fever.

There may also be:

- Ankle/leg swelling of both legs
- Crackles at base of both lungs and/or wheeze when listening to the chest
- Elevated neck veins
- A history of diabetes and/or high blood pressure and/or alcohol excess

### Decision Flow:

**Does the patient have any of these emergency signs?**

- Oxygen saturation is under 93%

- Chest pain that may indicate a heart attack

- Patient is in severe respiratory distress

- BP under 90 systolic

- Pulse is irregular AND over 100bpm (possible atrial fibrillation)

- IF YES → **Acute Heart Failure**

- Frusemide 40mg orally
- Ceftriaxone 1g stat
- Refer to hospital immediately
- IF NO → **If you suspect heart failure: contact a clinician or doctor.** Heart failure is difficult to diagnose and manage.

1. Medicate as below
2. Communicate as below
3. Screen for diabetes and high blood pressure – check a fasting blood sugar.

**Medicate:** Give medication for ONE WEEK only, then if heart failure is controlled can give medication for 1 month

**Step 1**

- Give Furosemide 40mg OD
- Start captopril 12.5mg bd (unless BP \<100/60)

**Step 2**

- If leg swelling and shortness of breath has improved, then STOP FUROSEMIDE but continue captopril.
- If improvement with reduced swelling and shortness of breath and Heart Rate is \>60, then add Propranolol 40mg bd
- If improvement after one week with BP and heart rate normal, continue same treatment for 1 month.

If worsens at any stage, or no improvement after 1 month REFER TO HOSPITAL.

**Communicate:**

- Heart failure is a condition where the heart is not pumping properly, and fluid backs up into the lungs and legs.
- Heart failure is a chronic condition which often has flare ups.
- Furosemide is used to remove fluid from the bodies, and other medication to help the heart pump more effectively.
- They need long term medication.
- They will need to be reviewed every month.
- Reduce salt consumption.

Drugs to avoid when you have heart failure:

- NSAIDS like Diclofenac and ibuprofen
- CCBs like nifedipine and amlodipine
- Prednisolone

1) First, if they have not been treated yet give MAGNESIUM tablets, 2 tabs TDS for 5/7
2) If they return with no improvement, then give OMEPRAZOLE 20mg BD for 7/7
3) If there is still no improvement after both magnesium trisilicate, and Omeprazole, give triple therapy of
- OMEPRAZOLE 20mg BD for 7/7
- METRONIDAZOLE 400mg TDS for 7/7
- AMOXICILLIN 500mg TDS for 7/7

## Animal Bites

### Dog, bat and other mammal bites

Follow standard wound care procedures except:

- Do not suture wound
- Give amoxicillin 500mg PO TDS for 5/7 and metronidazole 400mg PO TDS for 5/7

---

## Snake Bite

Establish the time and body-site of the bite, and snake species if known.

**Are there any signs of toxicity?**

1. Drooping of the eyelids or difficulty keeping eyes open
2. Abnormal eye movements or double vision
3. Difficulty swallowing or talking or pooling of saliva.
4. Weakness or reduced consciousness
5. Difficulty breathing.
6. Abnormal bleeding from anywhere
7. Blood in the urine on urine dipstick (only do dipstick once on initial presentation)
8. Any swelling or severe pain at the site of the bite or close to the bite
9. Pulse \>110 or Systolic BP \<90 in adults
10. Cold fingers or toes
- IF YES → Continue to WBCT test
- IF NO → Continue to WBCT test

**Check for abnormal clotting using Whole Blood Clotting Test 20 mins (WBCT20)** See next page for how to do this test.

**If signs of Toxicity OR WBCT positive**

- If Systolic BP \<90 give
- Adults: 1L NaCl STAT
- Children: 10ml/kg NaCl STAT
- Immediately refer ONLY to hospital with antivenom. Call the hospital first to make sure they have antivenom,
- Communicate: The patient might die if they do not go to hospital immediately and get anti-venom.

**If NO signs of toxicity AND WBCT negative**

1. Wash the wound site and remove clothes or jewellery around the site.
2. Keep the patient as still as possible.
3. Wash eyes for 2 minutes continuously with water if venom entered the eyes.
4. Observe the patient for at least 8 hours from the time of the bite.
5. Recheck the signs and symptoms of severe toxicity every hour.
6. Give pain relief as needed with paracetamol and tramadol ONLY. (NO Ibuprofen/Diclofenac)

DO NOT put any torniquet

If after 8 hours of observation, they have no signs of severe toxicity, recheck their WBCT20. If their WBCT20 is negative, they can go home.

If a patient presents \>8hrs after the bite and there are none of the above signs of severe toxicity and the WBCT20 is negative, they can go home with pain relief.

### 20 Minute Whole Blood Clotting Test

For diagnosis of coagulopathy following snakebite envenoming

**What you will need:**

1. Syringe, gloves, tourniquet, clean glass bottle
2. Take 2ml blood sample
3. Put 2ml blood in clean, dry glass bottle
4. Leave for 20 minutes \- DO NOT shake or move
5. After 20 minutes, gently tilt bottle
6. Results:
- NEGATIVE: Blood clots and stays solid when tilted
- POSITIVE: Blood remains liquid when tilted

---

## Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

- DO NOT diagnose make a diagnosis of hypertension after ONLY ONE blood pressure reading . Always re-test blood pressure 3-7 days after the first reading and only start medication and communicate if there are TWO high blood pressure readings above 160 systolic (see flowchart below)
- Review patients with hypertension every month
- Before changing treatment, check whether the patient has taken medication THIS MORNING. If they have not, continue current medications and review while the patient is actually taking medications.
- If pregnant, refer to medical officer at hospital for further management

### Decision Flow:

**Systolic BP above 200 OR Diastolic higher than 130** → **Malignant Hypertension**

- Give 40mg nifedipine PO STAT and refer to hospital

**Systolic 160-200 OR Diastolic 100-130 on TWO visits 5 days apart** → **Hypertension (stage 2\)**

- Communicate (as below)
- Start medication(as below)
- Check fasting glucose

**Systolic 140-159 OR Diastolic 90-99 on TWO visits 5 days apart** → **Hypertension (stage 1\)**

- Communicate (as below)
- Check fasting glucose (see diabetes)
- Start medication ONLY if the patient
1) smokes
2) has diabetes

**Systolic less than 139 and Diastolic less than 89** → **No hypertension**

- Don't start medication
- Check blood pressure again next visit

### Communicate

1) Eat less salt and Royco (has high salt content)
2) Do exercise e.g. walking fast and digging
3) Reduce weight through exercise and eating smaller portions of food
- They will likely have hypertension for life, they will never be cured completely
- The blood pressure must reduce to protect them from heart, brain, kidney and eye disease.
- They will need to be reviewed every month
- If medication is started, it is unlikely they will be able to stop.

### Medicate

Control means that BP \<140/85. If blood pressure is controlled, continue current medication. If not, add in steps as below. If a medication causes side effects, stop it and move to next step.

1. Start bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg OD PO for 1/12
2. If no control after 1 month, add nifedipine 20mg PO BD
3. If no control after adding nifedipine for 1 month, increase to nifedipine 40mg PO BD
4. If still not adequately controlled on bendroflumathiazide and 40mg nifedipine, add propranolol 40mg PO BD
5. If no control on three medications bendroflumathiazide, nifedipine and propranolol, refer to hospital.

If systolic blood pressure is \<120, stop one medication and review in one month

---

## Diabetes

### DIAGNOSIS: If a patient has any of these symptoms, or requests a Diabetes test, test the blood sugar.

- Increased thirst \- Urinating frequently \- Blurred Vision
- Extreme tiredness \- Overweight with High Blood Pressure \-Unconscious

Diagnose diabetes if:

1. the patient has eaten that day and has a RANDOM BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (BSL) over 11.0mmol
2. the patient has not eaten that day since midnight and has a FASTING BSL over 7.0 mmol

If the patient is UNDER 40, then refer immediately to a hospital, as it is probably type 1 diabetes that can only be treated with insulin. If patient is OVER 40, assume type 2 diabetes. The most important part of treatment is lifestyle change. Reducing sugar intake and reducing weight.

A BSL of below 4.0, is a medical emergency. If patient is conscious give. biscuits and juice or tea with sugar (not soda) STAT. Monitor until BSL improves. If unconscious give IV dextrose STAT and refer

A BSL of over 23mmol or glucose in urine analysis, is a medical emergency. If conscious give 1.5 litres water orally and 500mg metformin and glibenclamide 5mg PO STAT. Monitor until BSL reduces. If unconscious or ketones in urine analysis give 1L N/S IV stat and refer IMMEDIATELY.

### COMMUNICATE

- The main goal of Diabetes management is to REDUCE WEIGHT.
- Take NO Sodas, juice, biscuits, sweets, sugary tea or any foods with added sugar
- Local, traditional foods with 'food' and sauce are healthy and good, continue eating but in smaller portions
- Eat regular meals close to the time of taking the medications
- Try and increase exercise. E.g. Dig more, Bike or walk rather than take bodas. 30 Minutes a day is best.
- Diabetes is for life, you will need to check fasting BSL again 2 weeks after diagnosis, then every month
- Always ask the patient about burning skin, eyesight and skin ulcers as these show progression
- Every year the patient should get renal function tests
- If the patient or carer notices they are very tired, shaky, or anxious, they may have low blood sugar. They should take sugar tea or juice immediately and go to the health center
- BP needs to be monitored monthly. If BP \>140 systolic start on HTN medication.
- If the patient notices they are shaky, very tired or irritable, they may have low sugar. They should drink some sugary tea or a soda, and come for a sugar test immediately.

### MEDICATE

Ideal BSL is under 7.0mmol fasting. Before moving to the next step, make sure patient is taking medication.

Step 1\) NO MEDICATION change lifestyle only. Review in 2 weeks.

- If fasting BSL is \>8.0mmol 2 weeks after diagnosis, proceed to step 2\.

Step 2\) Metformin 500mg BD with meals.

- If on 2 consecutive visits has BSL over 8.0, then move to step 3

Step 3\) Metformin 1000 mg BD with meals.

- If on 2 consecutive visits has BSL over 8.0, then move to step 4

Step 4\) Metformin 1000 mg BD PLUS Glibenclamide 2.5mg OD

- If on 2 consecutive visits has BSL over 8.0, then move to step 5

Step 5\) Metformin 1000 mg BD PLUS Glibenclamide 5mg OD

If BSL still over 8.0 regularly after step 4, then refer to hospital to start insulin treatment.

- If the patient notices they are shaky, very tired or irritable, they may have low sugar. They should drink some sugary tea or a soda, and come for a sugar test immediately.

## Musculoskeletal Pain and Arthritis

Musculoskeletal pain is VERY common, especially in the back (waist), chest and shoulders. Sometimes this pain comes from a recent injury, but most of the time it has been present for a long time (chronic)

Step 1\) Assess the pain using these 5 assessment tools 'PQRST'. This will help you asses the real source of the pain and make sure there is no other more dangerous cause.

- Provocation & Palpation (pushing the painful area): What makes the pain start/worse? Is it worse when palpated?
- Quality: Ask the patient to describe the pain. Sharp, dull, aching etc.
- Region & Radiation: Where is the pain? Does the pain move/radiate anywhere?
- Severity: How bad is the pain? Mild, moderate, severe.
- Timing: How long does the pain last? How long has the pain been there?

Step 2\) Examine the patient. Look for swelling and redness, PUSH/PALPATE the affected area to see whether pain is there, then ask the patient to MOVE the affected area to see if it moves normally

If no infection or other illness, and worse on palpation or moving, diagnose musculoskeletal pain.

### Communicate

- Explain that pain is most likely coming from a tear or strain in their muscles, ligaments or tendons
- Encourage patient to continue normal activities and stretch. Sitting still usually makes pain worse
- If any activity (bending, digging, lifting) makes the pain worse, then stop doing that activity
- If pain has been present for over one month, it may last for a long time or never go away
- Invite the patient to continue to come back for medication if the pain continues
- Scans and X-rays are NOT USEFUL unless there is severe pain caused by a recent injury

### Medicate

The patent should only take tablets when there is pain. Don't take them regularly.

- Give Ibuprofen 400mg tds as needed for 6 days (36 tablets) UNLESS they have current PUD/Gastritis
- IF patient has current PUD/Gastritis give: Paracetamol 1g tds for 6 days (36 tablets)
- Give up to 2 weeks of pain relief (60 tablets) for long term pain

AND IF the pain is worse when you palpate (press) the area, also give

- Diclofenac gel to rub in one fingertip only twice a day to where the pain is.

AND IF the injury occurred on the day of presentation is very painful give Tramadol 50mg bd for 3 days (6 tabs)

Do NOT give antibiotics for Musculoskeletal Pain

## Headache

This guideline is for headaches that have been present longer than 1 week where there is no fever. If headache has been less than a week, look for other causes. These applies to over 12 year olds only.

**Give pre-referral treatment and refer patient to hospital if any of these features**

- Headache is so severe that the patient struggles to concentrate and talk with you

2) Tension headache if no symptoms other than headache. The diagnosis of tension headache can often be a secondary diagnosis, where the first diagnosis doesn’t have headache as a possible symptom
3) Migraine if nausea, or strange visual symptoms (loss of vision, flashing lights)

### Communicate

- Take medication when the headache just starts, before it becomes severe
- Increase drinking of water, especially in the morning
- Return if headache becomes more severe or if other symptoms develop
- If eyesight is poor, refer to hospital for assessment, as eye strain can cause or worsen headaches.

### Medicate FOR ALL patients

- Ibuprofen 400mg tds PRN for 6 days (OR Use PARACETAMOL if gastritis/ulcer present)

### Medicate FOR SOME patients

If Nausea from migraine ADD Metoclopramide 10mg Once with every headache (15 tablets)

If Difficulty Sleeping due to headache ADD Chlorpheniramine 4mg At NIGHT Once with every headache (15 tablets)

If patient has frequent migraines (At least monthly) with Nausea or visual symptoms Trial AMITRYPTILLINE 12.5 mg (1/2 tab) At NIGHT Once with every headache (15 tablets) Review in 1 month, and continue medication if it is working well

## Epistaxis

### Step 1\. Patient holds nose firmly

1. Sit up straight and tip head slightly forward NOT BACK
2. Use thumb and second finger to firmly pinch halfway up the nose
3. Keep pinching for a full 10 minutes without stopping

### Step 2\. Vital sign assessment (While patient is holding nose)

1. Check BP and pulse. If above 180 Systolic, give Nifedipine 40mg Stat and refer to hospital
2. If pulse above 110 BPM, or BP below 90 systolic, give 1L Normal Saline stat and refer to hospital
3. Check for anaemia. If present refer to hospital immediately

### Step 3 (If step 1 fails)

1. Soak a small 5cm long piece of cotton wool in adrenaline, and pack in the front of the nostril. Don't push the cotton wool far back.
2. Patient pinches their nose for a further 10 minutes as per step 1
3. Repeat Vital sign assessment

If bleeding does not stop, patient should be sent to hospital while continuing to hold their nose, and the cotton wool should remain in the nose.

If bleeding stops, carefully remove cotton wool before patient goes home, and advise patient

1. Not to blow their nose for the next 3 days
2. Not to put their finger into their nose
3. Not to lift heavy items for the next 3 days

## Dental Care

These two important messages should be given to all patients.

1. REDUCE SUGAR (biscuits, sodas, sweets, juice, tea with sugar). If patients want to take sugary food and drink, it is better they take it during mealtimes, rather than snacks between meals.
2. BRUSH TWICE A DAY, for 2 minutes each time. Everyone above 6 months old should have their teeth brushed, or brush their own teeth using toothpaste. 'ABC Dent' and 'Fresh Up' brands of toothpaste are OK, more expensive types are not necessary.

### Dental care for different ages

**0-5 months** Mother: Should brush twice daily, as bacteria can transfer from mother to baby Baby: WIPE GUMS with a clean cloth after breastfeeding. NO BRUSHING until 6 months Food: NO sugar at all, breastfeeding only

**6-11 months**

- Start brushing teeth as soon as they appear
- Use VERY SMALL amount of toothpaste (size of a sorghum grain)
- juice, Soda, and sweets should NOT be given to any child under 1 year old

**12 months – 5 years**

- Brush every day
- Use only very small amount of toothpaste (smaller than a pea)
- Encourage child to spit out the toothpaste
- Give few sugar treats \- child should only have soda, juice and sweets once a week.

**Pregnancy**

- Dental care is especially important for pregnant mothers, as bacteria from the mouth can pass between mothers and children. Pregnant mothers should be counselled to continue teeth brushing throughout the pregnancy.

**Communicate that if teeth hurt**

- We can give pain relief antibiotics as a temporary fix, but it will not solve the problem
- If teeth are painful you must see a dentist
- The longer you wait, the more difficult or expensive it may become to deal with the problem
